what is AD?
A directory is a hierarchical structure that stores information about objects on the network.
A directory service, such as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators. 
For example, AD DS stores information about user accounts, such as names, passwords, phone numbers, and so on, and enables other authorized users on the same network to access this information.

Active Directory stores information about objects(such as servers, volumes, printers, and the network user and computer accounts.) on the network and makes this information easy for administrators and users to find and use.
Security is integrated with Active Directory through logon authentication and access control to objects in the directory. 
With a single network logon, administrators can manage directory data and organization throughout their network, and authorized network users can access resources anywhere on the network.
