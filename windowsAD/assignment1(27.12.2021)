what is AD?
Active Directory (AD) is Microsoftâ€™s directory and identity management service for Windows domain networks.
A directory is a hierarchical structure that stores information about objects on the network.
A directory service, such as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators. 
For example, AD DS stores information about user accounts, such as names, passwords, phone numbers, and so on, and enables other authorized users on the same network to access this information.

Active Directory stores information about objects(such as servers, volumes, printers, and the network user and computer accounts.) on the network and makes this information easy for administrators and users to find and use.
Security is integrated with Active Directory through logon authentication and access control to objects in the directory. 
With a single network logon, administrators can manage directory data and organization throughout their network, and authorized network users can access resources anywhere on the network. 

Active Directory also includes:

A set of rules, the schema, that defines the classes of objects and attributes contained in the directory, the constraints and limits on instances of these objects, and the format of their names.
A global catalog that contains information about every object in the directory. This allows users and administrators to find directory information regardless of which domain in the directory actually contains the data.  
A query and index mechanism, so that objects and their properties can be published and found by network users or applications.
